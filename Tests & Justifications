Unit Testing
Purpose & Justification
Unit tests verify individual functions and components in isolation. For a password analyzer, this is critical because:

- [ ]Password strength algorithms must be deterministic and accurate
- [ ]String comparison functions need precise edge case handling
- [ ]Hash generation must be cryptographically correct
- [ ]Small bugs in security logic can have major consequences

Testing Methods
1.1 Password Strength Calculation
What to Test:

- [ ]Length validation
- [ ]Character type detection (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)
- [ ]Entropy calculation
- [ ]Pattern recognition (sequences, repetitions)

1.2 Context-Aware Detection
What to Test:

- [ ]Username detection in password
- [ ]Company name detection
- [ ]Fuzzy matching (Levenshtein distance)
- [ ]Case-insensitive matching
- [ ]Leet-speak detection

1.3 Hash Generation (SHA-1 for HIBP)
What to Test:

- [ ]Correct SHA-1 hash generation
- [ ]First 5 characters extraction
- [ ]Uppercase formatting

1.4 Pattern Detection
What to Test:

- [ ]Sequential patterns (abc, 123, qwerty)
- [ ]Keyboard patterns (asdf, zxcv)
- [ ]Date patterns (2024, 12/25/1990)
- [ ]Common dictionary words
