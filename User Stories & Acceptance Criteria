#Password Strength Analyzer - User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

## Epic: Context-Aware Password Strength Analysis System

### User Story 1: Basic Password Strength Evaluation
**As a** user creating an account  
**I want to** see real-time feedback on my password strength  
**So that** I can create a secure password

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Password strength is calculated as user types (real-time)
- [ ] Strength is displayed with visual indicator (e.g., Weak, Fair, Good, Strong, Very Strong)
- [ ] Color-coded feedback (red, orange, yellow, light green, dark green)
- [ ] Strength score updates within 100ms of typing
- [ ] Analysis includes:
  - Minimum 8 characters required
  - Checks for uppercase letters
  - Checks for lowercase letters
  - Checks for numbers
  - Checks for special characters
  - Evaluates password entropy/complexity
- [ ] Clear messaging explains why password is weak/strong

**Technical Notes:**
- Use zxcvbn library for entropy calculation
- Debounce input to optimize performance


### User Story 2: Context-Aware Username Detection
**As a** security-conscious user  
**I want to** be warned if my password contains my username  
**So that** I avoid easily guessable passwords

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System compares password against provided username (case-insensitive)
- [ ] Warning displayed if username is found in password
- [ ] Warning displayed if password is found in username
- [ ] Partial matches detected (e.g., "john" in "john123")
- [ ] Fuzzy matching detects similar strings (e.g., "j0hn" vs "john")
- [ ] Password strength score is reduced if username match found
- [ ] Clear error message: "Password should not contain your username"
- [ ] Leet-speak variations detected (e.g., "@" for "a", "3" for "e")

**Technical Notes:**
- Implement Levenshtein distance algorithm (threshold: 70% similarity)
- Check both directions (password in username, username in password)

### User Story 3: Company/Domain Name Detection
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** prevent users from using the company name in passwords  
**So that** corporate passwords are harder to guess in targeted attacks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System accepts company/organization name as input
- [ ] System accepts domain name as input
- [ ] Password is checked against company name (case-insensitive)
- [ ] Password is checked against domain name without TLD (e.g., "acme" from "acme.com")
- [ ] Warning displayed if company/domain name found in password
- [ ] Partial matches detected
- [ ] Password strength reduced if match found
- [ ] Clear error message: "Password should not contain company or domain name"
- [ ] Both forward and reverse checks performed

**Technical Notes:**
- Extract domain from email format (before @ symbol)
- Strip TLDs (.com, .org, .io, etc.)
- Use fuzzy matching with 70% threshold

### User Story 4: Breach Database Check (HIBP Integration)
**As a** security-conscious user  
**I want to** know if my password has been exposed in data breaches  
**So that** I can choose a password that hasn't been compromised

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Password is checked against Have I Been Pwned API
- [ ] Check uses k-anonymity model (only first 5 chars of SHA-1 hash sent)
- [ ] Results displayed within 2 seconds of user stopping typing
- [ ] Clear warning if password found in breach database
- [ ] Message shows number of times password was breached
- [ ] Strength score severely reduced if password is breached
- [ ] Visual indicator (⚠️ icon) for breached passwords
- [ ] "Checking..." loading state while API call in progress
- [ ] Graceful error handling if API is unavailable
- [ ] No plain text password sent over network

**Technical Notes:**
- SHA-1 hash password on client side
- Send only first 5 characters to HIBP API
- Match remaining hash characters locally
- Implement timeout (5 seconds)
- Cache results to reduce API calls

### User Story 5: Common Password Pattern Detection
**As a** user  
**I want to** be warned about common password patterns  
**So that** I avoid predictable passwords

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Detects sequential characters (e.g., "abc", "123", "qwerty")
- [ ] Detects repeated characters (e.g., "aaa", "111")
- [ ] Detects keyboard patterns (e.g., "qwerty", "asdf", "1qaz")
- [ ] Detects date patterns (e.g., "2024", "12/25/1990")
- [ ] Detects common words from dictionary
- [ ] Warning displayed for each detected pattern
- [ ] Specific feedback: "Avoid sequential characters" or "Avoid repeated characters"
- [ ] Password strength reduced based on pattern detection

**Technical Notes:**
- Build regex patterns for common sequences
- Use common password dictionary (top 10,000)
- Check for l33t speak variations

### User Story 6: Real-Time Feedback & Suggestions
**As a** user creating a password  
**I want to** receive helpful suggestions to improve my password  
**So that** I can quickly create a strong, secure password

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Suggestions displayed in real-time as user types
- [ ] Specific, actionable recommendations provided:
  - "Add uppercase letters"
  - "Add numbers"
  - "Add special characters (!@#$%)"
  - "Make it longer (at least 12 characters recommended)"
- [ ] Positive feedback when requirements met: "✓ Good length"
- [ ] Estimated time to crack displayed (e.g., "Would take centuries to crack")
- [ ] Suggestions disappear once requirement is met
- [ ] Maximum of 3-4 suggestions shown at once (prioritized)

**Technical Notes:**
- Use zxcvbn's crack time estimation
- Prioritize suggestions by impact on security

---

### User Story 7: Password Visibility Toggle
**As a** user  
**I want to** toggle password visibility  
**So that** I can verify I typed my password correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Eye icon button next to password field
- [ ] Clicking toggles between masked and visible password
- [ ] Icon changes to indicate current state (eye/eye-slash)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut supported (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + V)
- [ ] Accessible with screen readers
- [ ] Works on mobile devices

### User Story 8: Password Requirements Display
**As a** user  
**I want to** see password requirements upfront  
**So that** I know what is expected before I start typing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Requirements checklist displayed near password field
- [ ] Each requirement marked with ✗ or ✓ as user types
- [ ] Requirements include:
  - Minimum length
  - Character type requirements
  - Context-aware restrictions (username, company)
  - Not in breach database
- [ ] Visual progress indicator (e.g., 4/6 requirements met)
- [ ] All requirements must be met to submit form
- [ ] Requirements are configurable by organization

### User Story 9: Performance & Error Handling
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** ensure the password analyzer performs reliably  
**So that** users have a smooth experience without delays or errors

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Analysis completes within 100ms for basic checks
- [ ] HIBP API check completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] Debounced input (300ms) to reduce unnecessary calculations
- [ ] Graceful degradation if HIBP API unavailable
- [ ] Clear error messages for network failures
- [ ] No blocking of user input during API calls
- [ ] Rate limiting on API calls (max 1 per second)
- [ ] Loading states for async operations
- [ ] Works offline (except breach checking)
- [ ] Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
